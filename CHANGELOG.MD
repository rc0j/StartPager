Final release of the year! To recap: last year I started from scratch with the goal of turning Saturn Startpage into a more modern and ultra-fast startpage, and it’s been super fun. We’re closer than ever to having (somewhat) feature parity with the original Saturn Startpage. I’m excited for next year and expect a new **stable** release around mid-February if everything goes well :)
